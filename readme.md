## Testing

### Automated testing:

+ The first Django app I created was `gallery`, this is the simplest of all of my apps. The test I ran was simply to check both the model and the view to ensure the information being inputted was being read and fed back correctly. All of the tests for this came back perfectly. They can be found at: ![gallery] (C:\Users\14sam\.vscode\aquascape-haven\gallery\tests.py)
